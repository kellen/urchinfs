urchin-fs
=========

A FUSE-based filesystem which finds and reads arbitrary metadata files
and presents a faceted-search-style view on the containing directories.

Motivation
----------

Media file organization: id3 is insufficient for correctly organized 
mp3 collections, video/media collections have no such standard. 

Most media management programs organize only files, but the logical 
unit of organization is the *directory*, not the file. An "album"
may contain mp3/flac/ogg files, cover/cd scans, text files, etc. A
"movie" may contain multiple video files, samples, subtitles, cover
scans, etc.

Prerequisites
-------------

### Debian/Ubuntu

Add d-apt sources:

```
sudo wget http://master.dl.sourceforge.net/project/d-apt/files/d-apt.list \
          -O /etc/apt/sources.list.d/d-apt.list
sudo apt-get update 
sudo apt-get -y --allow-unauthenticated install --reinstall d-apt-keyring 
sudo apt-get update
```

Verify public key matches `0xEBCF975E5BA24D5E`

Install fuse and dmd:

```
sudo apt-get install \
     fuse libfuse2 libfuse-dev \
     dmd-bin
```
