urchin-fs
=========

A FUSE-based filesystem which finds and reads arbitrary metadata files
and presents a faceted-search-style view on the containing directories.

Motivation
----------

Media file organization: id3 is insufficient for correctly organized 
mp3 collections, video/media collections have no such standard. 

Most media management programs organize only files, but the logical 
unit of organization is the *directory*, not the file. An "album"
may contain mp3/flac/ogg files, cover/cd scans, text files, etc. A
"movie" may contain multiple video files, samples, subtitles, cover
scans, etc.
