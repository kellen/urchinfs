urchin-fs
=========

A FUSE-based filesystem which finds and reads arbitrary metadata files
and presents a faceted-search-style view on the containing directories.

Motivation
----------

Media file organization: id3 is insufficient for correctly organized 
mp3 collections, video/media collections have no such standard. 

Most media management programs organize only files, but the logical 
unit of organization is the *directory*, not the file. An "album"
may contain mp3/flac/ogg files, cover/cd scans, text files, etc. A
"movie" may contain multiple video files, samples, subtitles, cover
scans, etc.

Usage
-----

urchin-fs supports filtering on multiple facets, where the result is
entries which match all given facets. Facets are nested in a `^` 
directory, where `^` is the symbol for the 
[AND](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_conjunction) operation.

```
$ ls -1 example/
^
Easter Parade (1948, color)
Kiss Me Deadly (1955, bw)
The Lady Vanishes (1938, bw)
The Naked City (1948, bw)
$ ls -1 example/^/
color
year
$ ls -1 example/^/year/1948/
^
+
Easter Parade (1948, color)
The Naked City (1948, bw)
$ ls -1 example/^/year/1948/^/color/bw/
^
+
Easter Parade (1948, color)
The Naked City (1948, bw)

```

Each facet can be specified with multiple values, where the results
have one of these values. Values are nested in a `+` directory,
where `+` is the symbol for the 
[OR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction) operation.
(`v` was not used since it would be sorted as a letter, `âˆ¨` 
([vel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vel_%28symbol%29)) was not used 
since it cannot easily be typed on an average keyboard, and `|` was 
not used since it has special meaning on the command line).

```
$ ls -1 example/
^
Easter Parade (1948, color)
Kiss Me Deadly (1955, bw)
The Lady Vanishes (1938, bw)
The Naked City (1948, bw)
$ ls -1 example/^/year/
1938
1948
1955
$ ls -1 example/^/year/1948/
^
+
Easter Parade (1948, color)
The Naked City (1948, bw)
$ ls -1 example/^/year/1948/+/1955/
^
+
Easter Parade (1948, color)
Kiss Me Deadly (1955, bw)
The Naked City (1948, bw)
```

Originally, urchin-fs prefixed its facets with `+` and used `+OR` for 
providing additional values, but 
[UTF-8 collation rules](http://unicode.org/reports/tr10/#Multi_Level_Comparison) 
ignore punctuation in the first sorting stage, which resulted in the 
facets being mixed in with the directory listings.
